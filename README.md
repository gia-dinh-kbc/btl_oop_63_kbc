## OOP class INT2214_63 Group Project

This group project aims to consolidate knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) through developing a simple version of the classic game Arkanoid.

The objectives of this project are:
* Master and apply OOP principles to software design and implementation.
* Develop analytical, system design and problem-solving skills.
* Build a complete game application from Terminal version to graphical interface.
